## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

On this project I achieved some acquirements like how to properly use flexbox to align some itens inside the divs, the use of relative units to reach responsiveness and also the use of hexadecimal colors to decrease the load page timing. 

### Continued development

The pursue to write an more semantic HTML5 is now my main goal. It helps not only the SEO or accessibility but also a clean CSS code.
